# Claude Talk to Figma MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin that allows Claude Desktop and other AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to interact directly with Figma, enabling powerful AI-assisted design capabilities.

> **Important**: This project is based on [cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp) by Sonny Lazuardi. It has been adapted to work with Claude Desktop instead of Cursor and the modification tools have been expanded. The original implementation and main credit belongs to Sonny Lazuardi ❤️

## 🚀 Features

- **Native Claude Integration**: Allows Claude to communicate with Figma through the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Powerful Commands**: Manipulate objects in Figma, get information, create and modify elements
- **Advanced Text & Font Control**: Comprehensive text styling capabilities including font selection, spacing, and text effects
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Real-time WebSocket channel between Claude and Figma
- **Fluid Experience**: Design with AI as your assistant, accelerating creative workflows
- **Text Scanning**: Identify and manipulate text nodes within Figma documents
- **Remote Components**: Access and utilize components from team libraries
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with specialized tool modules
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust timeout and error recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improved handling of complex operations with chunking and batching

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- [Figma Desktop](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) installed
- [Figma](https://figma.com) account
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0.0 or higher 
  - Linux macOS ```curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash```
  - Windows ```powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"```

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp.git
   cd claude-talk-to-figma-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

4. Configure the MCP in Claude Desktop:
   ```bash
   bun run configure-claude
   ```
   Restart Claude Desktop if it was open.

   > **Note**: This script does the following:
   
   - Locates the Claude Desktop configuration file:
     - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
     - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Creates a backup of the existing configuration file
   - Modifies or creates the configuration file to include "ClaudeTalkToFigma" in the list of MCPs
   - Configures the command that Claude Desktop should execute to start the MCP

5. Install the Figma plugin:
   
   > **Note**: This project uses a custom Figma plugin located in the `src/claude_mcp_plugin` folder.

   - Open Figma
   - Go to **Menu > Plugins > Development**
   - Select "Import plugin from manifest"
   - Navigate and select the `src/claude_mcp_plugin/src/claude_mcp_plugin/manifest.json` file from this repository

   The plugin will appear in your development plugins list and you can use it like any other plugin.

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔌 Starting Up

Once installed, you just need to start it:

1. **Start the WebSocket server**:
   ```bash
   bun socket
   ```
   Verify it's running with `http://localhost:3055/status`
   
   > **Note**: if for any reason you need to stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

3. **Connect the plugin to the server**:

   Open the Claude MCP Plugin in Figma and copy the channel ID generated to provide it to Claude.

   <img src="images/mcp-figma-plugin-configuration.png" width="300" alt="Figma Plugin Configuration" />

4. **Claude Desktop**:

   Open Claude Desktop and confirm that "ClaudeTalkToFigma" appears in the MCPs selector.

5. **Ready to use!**

   Now you can send commands to Figma from Claude.

### 🧠 Prompting

1. Before you start designing with Claude, [make it an expert in UX/UI](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-specialist.md) 🎨
   
   > **Note**: Also in [Galician](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-gal.md), [Português](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-pt.md) and [Español](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-es.md).

2. Now tell Claude to connect to your Figma project:
   ```
   Talk to Figma, channel {channel-ID}
   ```

### Design Principles

The system follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **MCP Server**: Handles business logic, validation, and default values
- **WebSocket Server**: Routes messages between components  
- **Figma Plugin**: Pure translator that executes commands in Figma

This approach ensures that each layer has a single responsibility, making the system more reliable and easier to maintain.

- **Easy testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainable**: Changes to one layer don't affect others

For more details about previous and complete changes, check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems, check the following common issues:

### Common Issues

- **Connection Error**: Make sure the WebSocket server is running with `bun socket`
- **Plugin Not Appearing**: Verify that you've correctly linked the plugin folder in Figma Development settings
- **Claude Can't Find the MCP**: Make sure you've run `bun run configure-claude` and restarted Claude Desktop
- **Claude Not Responding**: Confirm you've selected "ClaudeTalkToFigma" in the MCPs menu
- **Execution Errors**: Check the Figma development console for detailed messages
- **Font Loading Issues**: Some fonts might not be available in Figma. Use `load_font_async` to verify font availability
- **Remote Components Error**: Team libraries might require proper permissions in Figma. Ensure you have access to the libraries you're trying to use

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes two complementary testing approaches:

### Automated Tests
